Getting Started
===============

**NNsight** (/ɛn.saɪt/) is a package for the interpreting and manipulating the internals of deep learning models.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

To get started with NNsight, install it with ``pip``. 

.. code-block:: console

   pip install nnsight

Please give the project a :ndif:`star on Github` to support the project. NNsight is open-source and you can read and clone the full source at https://github.com/ndif-team/nnsight.

Remote Model Access
-------------------

To remotely access LLMs through NDIF, you must sign up for an NDIF API key.

:bdg-link-primary:`NDIF API Key Registration <https://login.ndif.us/>`

NDIF hosts multiple LLMs, including various sizes of the Llama 3.1 models and DeepSeek-R1 models. 
All of our models are open for public use, but you need to apply for access to the Llama-3.1-405B models. 
You can view the full list of hosted models at https://nnsight.net/status/.

If you have a clear research need for Llama-3.1-405B and would like more details about applying for access, 
please refer to our  `405B pilot program application <https://ndif.us/405b.html>`_.

Access LLM Internals
--------------------

Now that you have your NDIF API key, you can start exploring LLM internals with NDIF and NNsight. 
We've put together a Colab notebook to help you get started.

:bdg-link-primary:`Open Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/ndif-team/ndif-website/blob/onboarding-fixes/public/notebooks/NDIFGetStarted.ipynb>`

This notebook will walk you through the following steps:

#. Installing NNsight
#. Setting up your NDIF API key
#. Loading a LLM in NNsight
#. Accessing and altering LLM internals remotely
